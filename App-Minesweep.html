<h2>2000-Playing Mine Sweeper</h2>
<br>
<b>Gameplay</b><br>
<br>
Your goal is to find all mines as quick as possible without dying. Click the smiley button to reset the board and start a new game.<br>
<br>
The mines are scattered throughout the board, which is divided into cells. At the beginning they are all covered, so you just see a blank field. Now you can start to discover the field by clicking on its cells.<br>
<br>
Cells have three states: covered, uncovered and flagged. A covered cell is blank and clickable, while an uncovered cell is exposed. Flagged cells are those which you marked to indicate a potential mine location.<br>
<br>
Left-click a cell to uncover it. If you uncover a mined cell, you are dead and the game ends. Otherwise, the uncovered cells displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile, and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be uncovered.<br>
<br>
If you think, that a cell covers a mine, right-click it to flag it, causing a flag to appear on it. Flagged cells are still considered covered. You can right-click it again to unflag it, if you think there won't be a mine.<br>
<br>
To win the game, you must uncover all non-mine cells, at which point, the timer is stopped. Flagging all the mined cells is not required.<br>
